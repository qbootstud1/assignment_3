# Assignment 3


This assignment consists of three separate Python projects. 
The idea is to generate Quantum Software Engineering Bootcamp
Art in the form of web pages using Scalable Vector Graphics
(SVG). The first two parts are short and constitute 
steppingstones to the larger Part 3.

This assignment should be a lot of fun!
