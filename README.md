# Assignment 3


In this assignment, you will conduct and document a simplified version of a data science
process (i.e., CRISP-DM) involving the phases of data preparation, modeling, and evaluation.
The main objective of this assignment is to practice the concepts, tools, and libraries introduced
in the third week of the bootcamp. For this, frameworks and modules such as matplotlib,
pandas, numpy, and sci-kit learn might prove useful.
